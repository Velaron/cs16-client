## Installation
To run CS16Client you need the latest developer build of Xash3D FWGS, which you can get [here](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous) (unless on [Android](https://github.com/Velaron/xash3d-fwgs/releases/tag/continuous-android)).
You have to own the [game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike//) and copy `valve` and `cstrike` folders into your Xash3D FWGS directory.
After that, just install the APK and run.
